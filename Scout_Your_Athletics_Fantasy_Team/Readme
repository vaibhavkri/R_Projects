Scout Your Athletics Fantasy Team

Project Description
If you were scouting out an athletics team, you would need to know more than 
just how far each person has jumped or thrown once. You want to know who is 
the most consistent, who fouls the least and who comes through in the clutch. 
And you will need to decide which aspects are most important to you so you 
can find the right balance.

In this R project, you will use data frames and the dplyr package to find out
who you should put on your team. You will use the six functions of dplyr to 
show why you should be the next "Moneyball" star manager of an athletics team.

You will use performance data collated from jumps and throws events in the 
US from 2013-2017.

It is recommended that you have completed Data Manipulation in R with dplyr, 
Cleaning Data in R, and Introduction to the Tidyverse prior to starting this
project.
