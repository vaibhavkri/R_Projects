Predict Taxi Fares with Random Forests
Project Description
In this project, you get to work with the data from a large number of taxi 
journeys in New York from 2013. You will use regression trees and random 
forests to predict the value of fares and tips, based on location, date and 
time.

Before taking on this Project, we recommend that you have completed Introduction 
to the Tidyverse. While not required, it can also help to have some extended 
experience with the packages dplyr, ggplot2 and randomForests which you can get 
in the following courses: Data Manipulation in R with dplyr, Data Visualization 
with ggplot2, and Supervised Learning In R: Regression.

The dataset used in this project is a sample from the complete 2013 NYC taxi data, 
which was originally obtained and published by Chris Whong.
