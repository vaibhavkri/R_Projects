Bad passwords and the NIST guidelines
Project Description
Almost every web service you join will require you to come up with a password.
But what makes a good password? In June 2017 the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) published publication 800-63B titled Digital Identity 
Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management. This publication doesn't 
tell you what is a good password, but it does have specific rules for what is a 
bad password.

In this project, you will take a list of user passwords and, using publication 
800-63B, you will write code that automatically detects and flags the bad passwords.

To complete this project, you need to know how to manipulate text using the 
stringr package and be familiar with regular expressions. If you haven't completed 
the course String Manipulation in R with stringr we recommend that you do so first.
