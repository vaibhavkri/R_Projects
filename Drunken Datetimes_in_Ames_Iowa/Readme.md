Project Description

In the Who Is Drunk and When in Ames, Iowa? project, you looked at breathalyzer test data 
from the State of Iowa. There was a lot of date-time manipulation that was hidden 
behind-the-scenes in that dataset. In this project, you will apply the skills you learned
in the Working with Dates and Times in R course to uncover temporal trends in the Ames 
breath alcohol data.

Anyone with familiarity with the lubridate, dplyr, and ggplot2 packages will be able to 
complete this project successfully. You will manipulate the dates and times in the breath 
alcohol data to answer questions such as, "What day has the most tests?", "at which hour 
of the day are breath alcohol tests most common?", and "are blood alcohol content (BAC) 
results higher on days when Iowa State University's football team plays?"
