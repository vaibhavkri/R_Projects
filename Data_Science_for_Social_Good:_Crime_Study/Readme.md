Data Science for Social Good: Crime Study


Project Description
Quantitative analyses can have a significant impact on initiating change within one's 
community. When analyzed responsibly, data can provide evidence to understand difficult 
social issues correctly. In this Project, you will leverage publicly available data to 
interpret crime patterns within the city of San Francisco.

To complete this Project, you should be comfortable manipulating data with dplyr and 
visualizing data with ggplot2. To prepare or brush up your skills, check out Data 
Manipulation in R with dplyr, and Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1).

The dataset used in this project is hosted on Kaggle and updated daily.
