Targeting treatment for heart disease patients\n<p>Clustering algorithms are used to group together items that are similar to one another. There are many industries where it would be beneficial and insightful to use an unsupervised learning algorithm - retailers want to group similar customers for targeted ad campaigns, biologists want to find plants that share similar characteristics, and more. We are going to explore if it would be appropriate to use some clustering algorithms to group medical patients. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_552/img/images-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We are going to look at anonymized patients who have been diagnosed with heart disease. Patients with similar characteristics might respond to the same treatments, and doctors would benefit from learning about the outcomes of patients similar to those they are treating. The data we are analyzing comes from the V.A. Medical Center in Long Beach, CA. For more information, see <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/heart-disease.names\">here</a>, and to download the data visit <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>Before beginning a project, it is important to get an idea of what the patient data looks like. In addition, the clustering algorithms used below require that the data be numeric, so it is necessary to ensure the patient data doesn't need any transformations. You will also be brushing up on your base R skills for some analysis.</p>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"tags":["sample_code"],"dc":{"key":"4"}},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/latex":"\\begin{tabular}{r|llllllllllll}\n id

Conclusion\n<p>Now that we've tried out multiple clustering algorithms, it is necessary to determine if we think any of them will work for clustering our patients. For the k-means algorithm, it is imperative that similar clusters are produced for each iteration of the algorithm. We want to make sure that the algorithm is clustering signal as opposed to noise. </p>\n<p>For the sake of the doctors, we also want to have multiple patients in each group so they can compare treatments. We only did some preliminary work to explore the performance of the algorithms. It is necessary to create more visualizations and explore how the algorithms group other variables. Based on the above analysis, are there any algorithms that you would want to investigate further to group patients? Remember that it is important the k-mean algorithm seems stable when running multiple iterations.</p>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"tags":["sample_code"],"collapsed":true,"dc":{"key":"67"}},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"# Add TRUE if the algorithm shows promise, add FALSE if it does not\nexplore_kmeans = ....\nexplore_hierarch_complete = ....\nexplore_hierarch_single = ....","execution_count":0}],"nbformat_minor":2}
