Clustering Heart Disease Patient Data

Project Description
Doctors frequently study former cases in order to learn ways to best treat their patients.
A patient who has a similar health history or symptoms to a previous patient could benefit 
from undergoing the same treatment. This project investigates whether doctors might be able
to group together patients to target treatments using some common unsupervised learning
techniques.

This project lets you apply clustering using the k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms. 
We recommend that you take the following courses before starting this project: Data Visualization
with ggplot2 (Part 1) and Unsupervised Learning in R.

The dataset for this project contains characteristics and measures of patients diagnosed with
heart disease. It can be found here.
