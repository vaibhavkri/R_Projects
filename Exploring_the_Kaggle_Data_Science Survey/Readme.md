Project Description

When beginning a career in data science, one often wonders what programming tools and 
languages one should learn first and what is being used in the industry. By exploring 
the 2017 Kaggle Data Science Survey results, you can learn about the tools used by 
10,000+ people in the professional data science community.

To explore this project, students should be familiar with dataframes, dplyr, tidyr, 
and ggplot2. This project uses a subset of the 2017 Kaggle Machine Learning and Data 
Science Survey dataset.

Before starting this project you should be comfortable manipulating data frames and 
have some experience working with the tidyverse packages dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2. 
We recommend that you have completed at least one of the following courses:

Introduction to the Tidyverse
Data Manipulation in R with dplyr
Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1)

This project uses a subset of the 2017 Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science Survey
dataset. If you want to know more about what tools and techniques Kaggle participants 
use do check out the full report of the Kaggle 2017 survey results.
