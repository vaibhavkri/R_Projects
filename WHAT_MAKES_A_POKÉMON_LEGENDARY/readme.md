Project Description
Not all Pokémon are created equal. Some are consigned to mediocrity, useless in battle until 
they reach their more evolved states. Others – like Zapdos, Articuno and Moltres – are so
unique and powerful that they have officially been classified as legendary.

But what exactly makes a Pokémon the stuff of legend? In this project, we will answer that
question with the help of a dataset that includes the base stats, height, weight and type of
801 Pokémon from all seven generations. Using the random forest algorithm, we will predict 
Pokemon status based on these characteristics and rank their importance in determining whether
a Pokemon is classified as legendary.

Students should be familiar with the tidyverse suite of packages, particularly ggplot2 for data
visualization and dplyr for data manipulation. They should also have experience with classification 
problems and tree-based methods, as taught through Supervised Learning in R: Classification and
Machine Learning with Tree-Based Models in R.

This project uses a subset of The Complete Pokemon Dataset published on Kaggle.
