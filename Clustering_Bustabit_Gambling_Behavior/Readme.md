Clustering Bustabit Gambling Behavior

Project Description
Have you ever wondered if you could quantify the behavior of gamblers at the casino? Some seem to win the most,
some can be reckless and risky with their bets, and others are casual about the whole experience. While collecting 
this data from the casino might be a challenge, there is an online platform called Bustabit in which gamblers can 
bet Bitcoin. We've collected data on thousands of Bustabit gambling sessions and tracked the user, the amount bet,
the amount won, and various properties of the particular game itself. Using this data, you will perform a cluster 
analysis from start to finish in an attempt to group gamblers based on their gambling behavior.

To complete this Project, students should be comfortable with R programming, the tidyverse package in particular, 
as the data manipulation and summarization routines will use this. Introduction to the Tidyverse and Writing 
Functions in R are suggested as prerequisites. Basic knowledge and understanding of the concepts of clustering 
(see Chapter 3 of Cluster Analysis in R) is a plus but is not required.

The dataset used includes 10,000 games of Bustabit. Each game tracks the particular gambler, the BustedAt value 
of the game, and the multiplier at which the gambler cashed out.
