Project Description

As statistics and machine learning methods become more pervasive, policymakers have also increased 
their use of these techniques when deciding how to allocate public resources. In this Project, you
will analyze economic and social development indicators for 22 provinces of Argentina to help plan
an education program.

This Project assumes you can manipulate data frames using dplyr, make simple plots using ggplot2,
and understand Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering. You can learn these skills 
from DataCamp's Introduction to the Tidyverse and Unsupervised Learning in R.

The data for this Project was published by INDEC and includes indicators such as poverty, population,
and GDP for each province.
