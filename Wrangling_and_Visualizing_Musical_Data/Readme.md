Wrangling and Visualizing Musical Data
Project Description
Apply data-wrangling and visualization tools from the tidyverse to musical data. 
Find the most common chords and chord progressions in a sample of pop/rock music
from the 1950s-1990s, and compare the styles of different artists. This project 
assumes familiarity with standard TidyVerse tools for R, in particular the tibble 
data structure and the dplyr and ggplot2 packages. No specific musical knowledge 
is required, though it may give you ideas for further exploration of the dataset 
after completing the project.

Before taking on this project we recommend that you have completed the following 
courses:

Introduction to the Tidyverse
Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 2)
This project uses a parsed and cleaned version of the McGill Billboard Dataset, 
version 2.0 (CC0 license).
