A Text Analysis of Trump's Tweets
Project Description
This tweet containing a hypothesis about Donald Trump's Twitter account needs to be investigated with data:

Every non-hyperbolic tweet is from iPhone (his staff).

Others have explored Trump’s timeline and noticed this tends to hold up. And Trump himself did indeed tweet 
from a Samsung Galaxy until March 2017. But how could it be examined quantitatively? In this project, you 
will apply text mining and sentiment analysis to determine whether or not Trump does indeed write the angrier,
Android tweets.

This project lets you apply the skills from Introduction to the Tidyverse, Data Visualization with ggplot2 
(Part 2), String Manipulation in R with stringr, and Sentiment Analysis in R: The Tidy Way. We recommend that 
you take those course before starting this project.

The dataset used in this project is from The Trump Twitter Archive by Brendan Brown, which contains all 35,000+ 
tweets from the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account from 2009 (the year Trump sent his first tweet) through 2018.
