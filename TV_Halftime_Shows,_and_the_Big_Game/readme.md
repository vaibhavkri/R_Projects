TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game

Project Description
Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's drama in the form of 
blowouts, comebacks, and controversy in the games themselves. There are the ridiculously expensive 
ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The halftime shows with 
the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding a giant mechanical tiger or leaping from the 
roof of the stadium. In this Project, you will find out how some of the elements interact with each 
other. You will answer questions like:

What are the most extreme game outcomes?
How does point difference affect television viewership?
How have viewership, TV ratings, and advertisement costs evolved?
Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
This Project gives you an opportunity to apply the skills from Introduction to the Tidyverse and Data 
Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1).

The dataset used in this Project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV 
files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
