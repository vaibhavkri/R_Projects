What Your Heart Rate Is Telling You

Project Description
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Researchers are 
using several data mining techniques to help health care professionals in the 
diagnosis of heart disease. In this project, you will examine the relationship 
between the maximum heart rate one can achieve during exercise and the likelihood 
of developing heart disease. Using multiple logistic regression, you will handle 
confounding effects from age and gender.

You will apply the skills you learned in Multiple and Logistic Regression, along 
with content from Introduction to the Tidyverse and Data Manipulation in R with 
dplyr, including basic data explorations with ggplot2 and dplyr.

This project uses the Cleveland heart disease dataset.
