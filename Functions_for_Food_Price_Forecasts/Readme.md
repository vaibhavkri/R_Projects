Functions for Food Price Forecasts
Project Description
Writing functions make your analyses more readable and more repeatable. In this project, 
you'll perform an analysis of potato prices in Rwanda, using the readr skills you learned 
in Importing Data in R (Part 1) to read the data, then wrangling and visualizing the data 
with dplyr and ggplot2 skills from Introduction to the Tidyverse, manipulating dates with 
lubridate skills from Working with Times and Dates in R, and forecasting future prices 
with forecast with skills from Forecasting Using R. You'll also wrap your code into 
functions using skills from Writing Functions in R, in order to apply your analysis to 
other food types.
