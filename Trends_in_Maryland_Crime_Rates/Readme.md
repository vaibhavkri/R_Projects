Trends in Maryland Crime Rates

Project Description
Note: this Project is soft launched, which means you may experience some bugs. Please click "Report an Issue" in 
the top-right corner of the Project interface to provide feedback.

Is the violent crimes rate in Maryland increasing, decreasing, or staying the same? In this Project, you will find 
out. First, you will wrangle the raw data supplied by the State of Maryland. Second, you will analyze the data 
using a hierarchical regression to examine both the statewide crime rate and crime rate for each Maryland county.
Third, you will plot the changes in crime rates for each county.

This Project requires both R and statistical skills. For R, this includes proficiency with the Tidyverse, including
ggplot2. These skills are taught in DataCamp Courses such as Introduction to the Tidyverse, Data Manipulation in R
with dplyr, or Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1). For statistics, this includes Hierarchical and Mixed Effects
Models and Multiple and Logistic Regression.

You will use the crime statistics from the State of Maryland from 1975 to 2016. The Maryland Statistical Analysis 
Center provides this and updates data.
