Project Description

In this project, you will explore two georeferenced data files collected from an echosounder to
determine where fish were along a track line in the Mid-Atlantic Bight (US). Marine ecologists 
use sound reflections to “see” different types of organisms in the water column and to determine 
the depth of the seafloor. You are going to load, clean, and plot bathymetric data (depth of the 
seafloor) to examine the shelf break, and the mean volumetric backscatter (Sv, dB re 1 m) along 
a transect in the Mid-Atlantic Bight area of the North Atlantic Ocean to find fishes.

To complete this project you should be comfortable working in the Tidyverse, plus working with dates
and times and writing functions. Working with Data in the Tidyverse, Working with Dates and Times in 
R, Joining Data in R with dplyr, and Writing Functions in R are this project's recommended prerequisites.
