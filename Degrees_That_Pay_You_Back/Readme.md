Degrees That Pay You Back

Project Description
Wondering if that Philosophy major will really help you pay the bills? Think you're set
with an Engineering degree? Whether you're in school or navigating the postgrad world, 
this project will guide you in exploring the short- and long-term financial implications 
of this major decision. After doing some data clean up, you'll compare the recommendations 
from three different methods for determining the optimal number of clusters, apply a k-means
cluster analysis, and visualize the results.

This project assumes familiarity with standard tidyverse tools for R. While not required,
it would also be helpful to have a prior understanding of clustering unsupervised data with
k-means. To learn or review these skills, check out Introduction to the Tidyverse and Cluster
Analysis in R.

The dataset used in this project is made available here by the Wall Street Journal.
