Project Description


R is a tool for doing serious statistics and data analysis. But not everything in life can be serious, life is also beautiful, 
and R can make beautiful things too. R can make art.

The arrangement of leaves on a plant stem is ruled by spirals. This fact is called phyllotaxis and it is a nice example of 
how mathematics can describe patterns in nature. In this project, we will invent flowers using this fact.

This R project assumes you have familiarity with the ggplot2 package. If you don't know ggplot2 we recommend you take either 
of the courses Introduction to the Tidyverse or Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1). If you want to see more examples of 
how you can use R to make art, you should check out the Fronkonstin blog created by Antonio Sánchez Chinchón.
